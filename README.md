Hi there, welcome to my Github repository!

My name is Stan Holko and I'm a recent graduate of the University of Toronto School Of Continuing Studies Data Analytics Bootcamp.

I've really enjoyed the course and am looking to change course in my career into the Data Analysis World.

If you would like to reach out, my email is stan.holko.jr@gmail.com or my linked in is https://www.linkedin.com/in/stan-holko/

Please feel free to review some of the projects I've worked on and let me know what you think!

Cheers, Stan
